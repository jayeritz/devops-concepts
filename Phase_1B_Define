## Software Delivery Cycle or Software Development Life Cycle is a process used by the software industry to design, develop and test high quality software. The SDLC aims to produce a high-quality software that meets or exceeds customer expectations, reaches completion within times and cost estimates. SDLC works by lowering the cost of software development while simultaneously improving quality and shortening production time. Popular SDLC models include the waterfall model, spiral model, and Agile model.  There are six phases:
•	Requirement analysis
•	Planning
•	Software design such as architectural design
•	Software development
•	Testing
•	Deployment

## Test Driven Development is a design technique focused on writing clean code that works. It is a programming practice that instructs developers to write new code only if an automated test has failed. The foundations of TDD are focused on using small tests to design systems from the ground up in an emergent manner, and to rapidly get value while building confidence in the system. (TDD = Refactoring + TFD) | TTD has 6 steps:
1.	Add a test
2.	Run all tests and see if the new test fails
3.	Write the code
4.	Run tests
5.	Refactor Code
6.	Repeat

## Continuous Integration is a development practice where developers integrate code into a shared repository frequently, preferably several times a day. Each check-in is then verified by an automated build, allowing teams to detect problems early.

## Continuous Delivery is a software development practice where code changes are automatically prepared for a release to production. A pillar of modern application development, continuous delivery expands upon continuous integration by deploying all code changes to a testing environment and/or a production environment after the build stage. When properly implemented, developers will always have a deployment-ready build artifact that has passed through a standardized test process. 

## Configuration Management is a process for maintaining computer systems, servers, and software in a desired, consistent state. It's a way to make sure that a system performs as it's expected to as changes are made over time. Configuration management keeps you from making small or large changes that go undocumented.

## Containerization involves bundling an application together with all of its related configuration files, libraries and dependencies required for it to run in an efficient and bug-free way across different computing environments. The most popular containerization ecosystems are Docker and Kubernetes. is defined as a form of operating system virtualization, through which applications are run in isolated user spaces called containers, all using the same shared operating system (OS).

## Cloud Scalability, and Reliability: Scalability in cloud computing is the ability to quickly and easily increase or decrease the size or power of an IT solution. A scalable cloud is why you can sign up and use most cloud solutions in just a few minutes – if not seconds. It refers to the ability to increase or decrease IT resources as needed to meet changing demand. Reliability measures the ability of a piece of equipment to perform its intended function for a specific interval without failure.
